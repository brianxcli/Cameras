# RtcWithFaceUnity

The camera helper module to provide a couple of features that developers need when implementing camera applications.

## Camera Module

* Maintains the whole life cycles of Android Camera2 API, meanwhile giving a flexible control over the camera connections
* Reduces the coupling between components where developers find hard to keep each one apart
* Previewing on a TextureView instead of SurfaceView, and animations of the local preview are available right away
* Hardware acceleration is fully taken advantage of
* Integration with Face Unity library in a better way
